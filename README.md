#Election Project for UC Berkeley's Statistics 133 Course: Concepts in Computing with Data

Took election results from 2008, 2012, 2016 and US Census Data to create a large data frame of election and census data for each county in America. 
Created a map to describe US voting trends. Also created two predictors for 2016 election results and 2012 - 2016 changes.
